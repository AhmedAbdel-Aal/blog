I am **Ahmed Abdou**, senior student at German University in Cairo. I conducted my BSc. project at University of Stuttgart as exchange student, where I applied concepts of deep learning and feature representation using gaze data for building cognitive models.

My interests lie in deep learning. My first deep learning deployed application is Arabic Poetry Generation, check it [here](https://arabic-poem-generator.herokuapp.com/). Coupled with a data-set, that I scraped and prepared entirely, of Arabic poems that contain 55K poem for over 540 poet from 19 different countries and 9 different eras at [Arabic-poetry-dataset at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedabelal/arabic-poetry).
